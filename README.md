Concurrency is not Parallelism by Rob Pike

BOOKS - 

- `Textbook: Introduction to Multithreaded, Distributed, and Parallel Programming (2000)` has the best and most complete teaching on the Go style of concurrent programming, which is actually named Concurrent Sequential Processes. Many other styles of concurrent programming are also explained, compared, and contrasted, both for shared memory as well as distributed memory systems.

- `Textbook: The Go Programming Language` has two excellent chapters on concurrency with examples that steadily grow in complexity. It's not free, but it's well worth the price IMO as it contains useful information for all features of the language except generics.
